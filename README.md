# Kare-Application
An application designed to help improve the care of medically complex children, ease the burden on parents, and help provide statistical analyses of logged data.

Due to the nature of the application and the client, I cannot publicly share the entire application on my repository.
However, I can upload my primary code contribution and the documentation for the project and the component that I worked on.
The Kare Application has three core components:
1) A mobile application for logging and scheduling events
2) A desktop application for storing and analyzing logged data
3) A server to serve as an intermediary between the mobile and desktop applications

This was a group capstone project with a team consisting of eight members. I was part of the Desktop team and worked primarily on that component of the application.
This project was the second iteration of a project that was started by a previous team. The primary objective of my group was to fix and improve upon the code that
was provided by the previous team, and to add new features based on new client requirements.

I worked on bug fixing and updating/improving the UI of the desktop application. However, my primary contribution to the desktop application was the implementation
of a new page based on a client request. The page was supposed to take JSON data files created by the server as input and sort through the data based on filters. 
It then displays the filtered data, which the user can interact with. When the user clicks on a filtered event, the page will then display all of the data for that
specific event in the inputted data file.

This repository contains the python file for the page that I described above, as well as the user manual for the desktop application and the final documentation for
my group's iteration of the project.
